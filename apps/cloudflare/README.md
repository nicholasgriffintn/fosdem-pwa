# FOSDEM PQA - CloudFlare shared code

This directory contains the shared code for Cloudflare Workers applications. This includes the migrations for the database as well as the state that will be persisted across the applications.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The migrations in this directory will be generated by Drizzle from the web app. Never edit these manually, adjust the schema in the web app and then run the db:generate command to update them.
