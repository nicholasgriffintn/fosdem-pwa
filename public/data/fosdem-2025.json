Does Lennart actually run an image based system himself?!! The answer is no! He runs a mostly stock Fedora system (luckily without grub). So how do we get Lennart onto an image based system? That's where ParticleOS comes in, an image based distribution built completely on top of systemd tooling that intends to implement all of the ideas presented and implemented by Lennart across the years.</p>\n<p>Unlike other image based distributions, ParticleOS focuses on letting users assemble, configure and sign their own image based distribution instead of providing a prebuilt and presigned one that is hard to customize. Users build ParticleOS themselves and sign it with their own keys. As ParticleOS is built with mkosi, any distribution supported by mkosi can be used as the base distribution and users can customize the image to their liking (adding packages, running arbitrary commands, switching to a different filesystem, ...).</p>\n<p>This talk will first expose Lennart, then introduce ParticleOS, compare it to other image based distributions and hopefully convince the listeners that ParticleOS is a good fit for power users looking for a customizable, self-signed image based distribution based on top of all the ideas evangelized by Lennart over the years.</p>\n<p>ParticleOS: https://github.com/systemd/particleos\nmkosi: https://mkosi.systemd.io/</p>"

Crucially, it also offers the capability to maintain consistent IP addresses for virtualization workloads, ensuring stability during VM lifecycle events.</p>\n<p>Through a live demonstration, attendees will learn practical steps to implement traffic isolation using OVN-Kubernetes User Defined Networking functionality. Including NATed egress and stable IP addressing for VMs on their clusters. By the session's end, participants will understand how to tailor Kubernetes networking to meet their organization's specific requirements, bridging the gap between Kubernetes' flexible architecture and the stringent networking needs of both traditional virtualization and managed Kubernetes environments.

Fedora is working on making all package builds reproducible, and with 8500 Python source packages, we quickly found out that differences in bytecode give us grief. One source of the difference (reference flag numbering) has been known for a while. But after cleaning that up, we found that there are at least two other ways in which bytecode is irreproducible: one related to reference use (also solved), one related to object order (still unsolved). In this talk we'll describe the problem and report how Fedora rewrites bytecode files in package builds to make them smaller and reproducible.</p>"

Inspired by languages such as Scratch and Blockly, we have developed a blocks-based interface for pure logic. Crucially, we have proceeded to turn our blocks physical: children are given tangible \"puzzle pieces\" instead of a keyboard and mouse. This physical nature makes the tool more inviting and fun to play with, yet can still express everything we want.</p>\n<p>The setup consists of a camera attached to a Raspberry Pi, which is connected to a computer screen. On the computer screen, children are presented with two groups of three robots each. A logic rule separates both robot groups (e.g., in one, all robots have a green arm, compared to none in the other). The goal is for the children to figure out this rule, and compose it by assembling the \"puzzle pieces\" into the correct configuration representing this rule. The Raspberry Pi then detects the blocks and verifies their correctness using an open-source logic engine. If correct, it continues on to the next level. If incorrect, it explains to the children where they went wrong, so that they can try again. In this sense, FOLL-E is meant to be very interactive.</p>\n<p>From the get-go, we wanted FOLL-E to be freely available to everyone. As such, all aspects of FOLL-E are open source and available online for free, including among others the code and the design plans for the blocks. Furthermore, we are working on a detailed step-by-step building guide, aimed at e.g. schools. In a sense, anyone with access to a laser cutter and a Raspberry Pi can make their own setups -- which we strongly encourage you to do. :-)</p>\n<p>Feel free to check out https://FOLL-E.com for pictures/videos of FOLL-E or https://gitlab.com/Vadevesi/foll-e to take a look at the source code.</p>"

      "abstract": "<p>In this talk, I will introduce <strong>Syd</strong>, a <a href=\"https://gitlab.exherbo.org/sydbox/sydbox/-/blob/main/COPYING\">GPL-3 licensed</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigran_Petrosian\">rock-solid</a> application kernel designed for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)\">sandboxing</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software\">applications</a> on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux\">Linux</a> systems (version 5.19 and above). Over the past 16 years, Syd has evolved from a tool used within <a href=\"https://www.exherbolinux.org/\">Exherbo Linux</a> to detect package build mishaps into a robust security boundary for applications. The recent rewrite in <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a> leverages modern Linux APIs such as <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html\"><em>seccomp-unotify(2)</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat2.2.html\"><em>openat2(2)</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pidfd_getfd.2.html\"><em>pidfd_getfd(2)</em></a> to eliminate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use\">time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTTOU)</a> vulnerabilities, which is essential for building a secure sandbox.</p>\n<p>Syd aims to provide a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\">simple interface</a> over complex Linux sandboxing mechanisms -- including <a href=\"https://landlock.io/\">Landlock LSM</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces\">namespaces</a>, <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html\"><em>ptrace(2)</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html\">seccomp-BPF/Notify</a> -- which are often considered <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/796108/\">brittle</a> and <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/795128/\">difficult to use</a>. This approach is somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.openbsd.org/\">OpenBSD</a>'s <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2\"><em>pledge</em>(2)</a> system call, offering a practical way to restrict application behavior. Unlike other sandboxing tools like <a href=\"https://falco.org/\">Falco</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap\">Bubblewrap</a>, <a href=\"https://firejail.wordpress.com/\">Firejail</a>, <a href=\"https://gvisor.dev/\">gVisor</a>, and <a href=\"https://google.github.io/minijail/\">minijail</a>, Syd operates <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_separation\">without requiring extra privileges</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid\">SETUID</a> binaries, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_(computing)\">privileged kernel context</a>. It adheres to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy\">UNIX philosophy</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well\">doing one thing well</a> with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege\">the least privilege</a> necessary.</p>\n<p>The presentation will cover Syd's key features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Path Sandboxing</strong>: Controls filesystem access through various operations including read, write (with append-only paths and path masking), stat (aka path hiding), tmpfile creation, attribute changes, truncation, node creation, file creation, and deletion.</li>\n<li><strong>Execution Control</strong>: Implements exec sandboxing with SegvGuard, force sandboxing for verified execution, and Trusted Path Execution to enforce strict execution policies.</li>\n<li><strong>Network Sandboxing</strong>: Restricts network access, supporting UNIX, IPv4, IPv6, Netlink, and KCAPI sockets, along with application firewalls and IP blocklists.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced Features</strong>: Includes lock sandboxing using Landlock LSM, proxy sandboxing with network namespace isolation (defaulting to TOR), memory and PID sandboxing as simpler alternatives to control groups, SafeSetID for secure UID/GID transitions, and Ghost mode for enhanced process isolation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will also discuss how Syd addresses common security challenges such as TOCTOU issues and side-channel attacks, aligning with a threat model similar to that of seccomp. Attendees will gain insights into the design and implementation of Syd, its practical applications in enhancing system security, and how it can be integrated into various environments -- including as a login shell -- to provide robust application isolation.</p>"

We used this to add errors when using file descriptors that can be reported by any valgrind tool by using --track-fds=yes. This allows reporting on bad use of file descriptors, file descriptors that are double closed, used after closing, and file descriptors that \"leak\". Because these are \"normal\" valgrind errors all these events can be reported in the xml output, suppressed by the user, intercepted by gdb and integrated in CI runs with --error-exitcode.</p>\n<p>For Valgrind 3.24.0 we added bad file descriptor usage errors.</p>"

But DoH isn't available to all our users.\nWith HTTPS records becoming increasingly important, we decided to resolve HTTPS queries using system APIs like <code>DNSQuery_A</code>, <code>res_query</code>, <code>res_nquery</code>, and <code>android_res_query</code>, with the expectation that this would cover all supported platforms.

However, by utilizing MySQL's server component plugin and UDF, the <em>MyVector Plugin</em> successfully adds a fully functional vector search feature within the existing MySQL + InnoDB infrastructure, eliminating the need for a separate vector database. The session explains the technical aspects of integrating vector support into MySQL, the challenges posed by its architecture, and real-world use cases that showcase the advantages of combining vector search with MySQL's robust features.

As a robotic microscope, it is able to automatically scan microscope slides creating, enormous multi-gigapixel digital representations of samples. The microscope is already undergoing evaluation for malaria and cancer diagnosis in Tanzania, Rwanda, and the Philippines. As an open project our key goal is to support local manufacturing of microscopes in low resource settings. But, how can an open source project empower local manufacturers to make hardware certified for diagnostic use?</p>\n<p>Collaborative hardware design is notoriously difficult without complex Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems. However, Git provides more powerful version control than the most expensive proprietary PLM systems, especially if you use a code-based CAD package. Platforms like GitLab give clear records of project management through issue and merge request threads. Also, CI pipelines give us the ability to perform regular code quality checks, automate the generation of print-ready 3D models, and to generate detailed always-up-to-date assembly documentation and diagrams.</p>\n<p>This high-quality consistent documentation has enabled thousands of microscopes to be built around the world, in over 50 countries. Microscopes have been used on all seven continents, from the Antarctic sea ice to the rainforest in Panama. They have been used for educational workshops in Sweden and Ghana, and even built by mobile makerspaces in wartime Ukraine. Hospitals already use the microscope to for remote consultancy and training, however without certification it cannot be used for diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Combining good documentation with accessible calibration routines, gives manufacturers and users confidence that their locally-manufactured device performs as well as the thousands of other OpenFlexure Microscopes around the world. Building in robust calibration is crucial in our push towards medical certification.</p>\n<p>This talk will involve live microscopy demonstrations, give an overview of the microscope and its applications, as well as diving into deeper questions of open source workflows for managing diagnostic device design.</p>"

Only once the exclusive reference is used as exclusive, all the derived or \"reborrowed\" shared references are invalidated.

This talk will showcase three key tools that make quantum programming more approachable for developers - </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>qBraid-runtime</strong> simplifies quantum software pipelines, providing a streamlined workflow that allows developers to build and execute applications efficiently. </li>\n<li><strong>qBraid-transpiler</strong>, part of our qBraid-SDK, enables seamless conversion of quantum programs across different quantum computing packages, such as Qiskit and Cirq, making it easier for users to work with various frameworks without compatibility issues. </li>\n<li><strong>PyQASM</strong> offers semantic analysis and compilation support for OpenQASM, equipping developers with tools to write, debug, and optimize quantum code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together, these tools support a global, platform-agnostic, open-source ecosystem, empowering anyone to explore, innovate, and contribute to quantum computing. This talk will demonstrate how qBraid‚Äôs tools enable users to better think about \"what\" they want to do, without worrying about the implementation details, thereby paving a path to a more accessible future for quantum technologies.</p>\n<p>References - \n1. qBraid-SDK : https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid\n2.

      "abstract": "<p>As containers continue to reshape how applications are deployed and managed, bootable containers have emerged as the next frontier‚Äîextending cloud-native concepts down to the operating system itself. In this talk, we‚Äôll introduce Bootc and explore how it powers image-based OS deployment, boot integrity, and manageability. By leveraging Bootc, the operating system becomes as portable and manageable as a containerized app, bridging traditional OS management with modern DevOps practices.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôll cover \"Image Mode\" for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, an approach that allows developers, operations teams, and solution providers to manage the entire OS as a container image. Image Mode incorporates the bootc CLI, the main command-line tool for managing updates and other tasks on end devices, along with the bootc-image-builder, which can generate a variety of image types. These include disk images (such as ISOs) suitable for disconnected installations, and virtual disk image formats like QEMU Copy-On-Write (QCOW2), Amazon Machine Images (AMI), and Virtual Machine Images (VMI). This method not only reduces complexity across environments but also enables a unified DevOps approach, integrating seamlessly with container-native tools and CI/CD pipelines. Attendees will learn how image-based deployments address security needs with containerized scanning, validation, and signing tools, and hear about opportunities for standardization within the container ecosystem to ensure boot and operational integrity at scale.</p>"

Both Large Language Models and other generative models for image/video/sound use huge deep learning models, running on expensive and energy intensive GPUs. However there are several other application areas of machine learning, operating under other contraints. One of these is the area of \"TinyML\", where machine learning is used to analyze sensor data on microcontroller-grade systems. A typical TinyML system is under 1 watt, under 1 MB of RAM and FLASH and under 10 USD bill-of-materials.</p>\n<p>emlearn is an open-source project started in 2018, which provides machine learning inference implementations for microcontrollers. It is written in portable C99 code, and supports models trained with scikit-learn and Tensorflow/Keras. Since 2023 the emlearn project also provides bindings for MicroPython, a Python for microcontrollers.</p>\n<p>In this talk we will talk about machine learning on microcontrollers; the applications, developments in the field over the last years, and current trends - both on software and hardware side. This niche of machine learning is extremely concerned with computational efficiency, and we believe that these perspectives may be useful also to developers working in different areas.</p>"

The rise of confidential computing on cloud platforms facilitates the deployment of TEE-enabled server applications, which are expected to be widely adopted in web services such as privacy-preserving LLM inference and secure data logging. One key feature is Remote Attestation (RA), which enables integrity verification of a TEE. However, <em>compatibility</em> issues with RA verification arise as no browsers natively support this feature, making prior solutions cumbersome and risky. </p>\n<p>To address these challenges, in this talk, we present RA-WEBs (<strong>R</strong>emote <strong>A</strong>ttestation for <strong>Web</strong> <strong>s</strong>ervices), a novel RA protocol designed for high compatibility with the current web ecosystem.

We have thus constructed a framework to understand and to explain Research Software and Research Data in the Open Science context [5].</p>\n<p>This framework is constructed in three stages: definition, dissemination, and evaluation of these research outputs [2,3,4], and it is now completed with answers to the Borgman's conundrum challenges for Research Data [3] and for Research Software [6].</p>\n<p>In this talk we will present our answers to the Borgman's conundrum challenges,  and we will explain the comparison methodologies that we have developed in order to construct and to complete this Open Science framework.</p>\n<p>It is our understanding that to provide correct and clear answers to the conundrum questions will have, as a consequence, the improvement of Research Software and Research Data sharing and dissemination practices, which, in turn, will enhance trustworthiness, correctness, rigor, reproducibility, reusability and transparency in the research endeavor.</p>\n<p>This work extends our talks at FOSDEM:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[FOSDEM'21] Free/Open source Research Software production at the Gaspard-Monge Computer Science laboratory.

      "abstract": "<p>WireGuard is a great protocol to set up a virtual private network (VPN). However, the challenge is to make it work on networks that block or mangle user datagram protocol (UDP) traffic. Certain hotspots, such as those at hotels, events, cafes &amp; restaurants block UDP traffic and only allow web traffic over the transmission control protocol (TCP) usually port 80/443. Even if a network allows UDP traffic, there can be issues with certain packets not going through due to issues regarding maximum transmission units (MTU).</p>\n<p>Supporting TCP is left explicitly out of scope for the WireGuard project and should be handled by an upper layer obfuscation tool [1]. There is a good reason for this: TCP-over-TCP has bad performance (e.g. website traffic over a TCP VPN). However, in these networks the choice has to be made between no VPN connectivity or at least something as a fallback. For this reason, there are some tools which aim to proxy UDP packets over TCP.</p>\n<p>Many of these tools, however, do not directly allow you to put it behind a reverse proxy. The advantage of using a reverse proxy is that you can use your existing web server to (next to tunneling it over TCP) obfuscate the traffic with TLS and tunnel your WireGuard traffic through the same port that is serving normal websites. In this talk, I will introduce a tool called ProxyGuard which aims to solve this use case. I explain why I came up with this approach in the first place, what challenges I had implementing it and possible improvements for the future.

      "abstract": "<p>Panoptic is a tool to explore locally and easily big images datasets: https://github.com/CERES-Sorbonne/Panoptic\nImages abound on the web and digital social networks. Their proliferation is one of the characteristics of digital culture. In particular, they are widely mobilized in contemporary controversies, with the aim of revealing and debating important social issues. Far beyond natively digital images, whether moving or still, images are first and foremost an object of study in their own in many disciplines (art history, film studies...), just as they can be a way of accessing a research field (photographs of animal and plant species, pages from digitized books...). A key challenge for the human and social sciences is to equip themselves with tools for exploring, sorting and annotating image corpora.</p>\n<p>While a number of tools already exist for working with such corpora (XnView, Tropy, voxel51, Aikon, Arkindex<strong>,</strong> for example), a key issue to be resolved is the multiplication in the number of images we work with: how can we efficiently explore, sort and annotate a corpus of several tens of thousands of images? How can we provide researchers with a tool that facilitates such work?</p>\n<p>Indeed, working with a large number of images means first of all having a synoptic view of them, in order to understand them as a whole, but also being able to manipulate them directly in the presentation interface (for both exploration and analysis).</p>\n<p>Secondly, working with a large number of images also imposes time constraints on analysis, which can be resolved by using similar-image clustering tools (computer vision tools), to group together images that have formal similarities (reduces exploration time), but also by using batch annotation functionalities (reduces analysis time).</p>\n<p>Finally, working with images is rarely just about working with images, but also with textual data associated with the images (texts of tweets, photographer's name, shooting date, etc.). Another challenge, then, is to adopt a plurisemiotic approach to the content of the corpus being worked on, in order to avoid having to move back and forth between different work spaces.</p>\n<p>Created at CERES, by developers, researchers and designers, Panoptic is an open source tool for visualizing, exploring and annotating large images corpora. In particular, the tool integrates algorithms for grouping images by similarity (by using ml model CLIP), to help users with sorting and exploration. The tool also offers various filtering, search and annotation options, enabling the creation, analysis and export of sub-corpora.</p>\n<p>Our talk will present the tool we have developed, and how its various functions are designed to meet the methodological needs of research using tools for working with large volumes of images.</p>"

We already demoed a prototype in action at KVM Forum [4]. In this talk, we will briefly describe our motivation for this work for the benefit of those not present in the KVM Forum. Then, we will argue how signed UKIs can be a simple, easier and guest OS agnostic means of deploying the trusted and measured firmware images for tenants in the cloud. We will also describe how UKIs can trigger an update of the firmware using our proposed simple hypervisor interface. Discussions around implementing this have already started within the systemd community [2][5]. We will describe some of the details around our design decisions. We will also seek inputs from the community on implementing the hypervisor specific support needed in UKI for interacting with the hypervisor by proposing some initial ideas.</p>\n<p>This talk is mostly UKI/systemd focussed.

      "abstract": "<p>VACASK is a novel FOSS analog circuit simulator with a clear separation between device models (i.e. equations) and circuit analyses. It is based on the state of the art KLU sparse matrix library and utilizes the OpenVAF Verilog-A compiler for building its device models from Verilog-A sources. A comparison with other FOSS analog circuit simulators is presented and the roadmap for future development is discussed. A major obstacle in development of VACASK (and every other new simulator) is the implementation of legacy device models that boils down to writing tens of thousands of lines of C code. Legacy device models are used in several older PDKs as well as in models of a large number of discrete electronic components. A novel approach to implementing these device models is proposed: a converter from SPICE3 API-based C code into modern Verilog-A code. The limitations of the approach are presented and the validation of the resulting Verilog-A models is discussed. The performance of the converted models is compared to that of native SPICE3 models. At the present the converted models can be used in VACASK and Ngspice circuit simulators as well as in any other simulator that supports Verilog-A. Some alternative use cases for the converter are proposed and a roadmap for its future development is presented.</p>"

We will begin with an overview of Vitess‚Äô architecture, highlighting horizontal sharding and its advantages for scaling. Next, we will dive into the powerful workflows Vitess provides for data import and live production migrations, emphasizing their safety, efficiency, and reversibility‚Äîeven for massive datasets.</p>\n<p>To ground these concepts, we will share real-world examples of successful migrations from web-scale Aurora and legacy MySQL databases, including performance metrics, data sizes, and challenges encountered.

Television sets were used as display devices, with a set top box or built-in decoder proving the terminal functionality.  Communication was bi-directional with a low-speed back channel that allowed typing in text messages.</p>\n<p>The introduction of Bildschirmtext overlapped with the home computing era, but for regulatory reasons, home computers could not easily be used as Bildschirmtext terminals.  This, among other technical and non-technical reasons, caused the service to fail to reach its full potential.  It remained in use as a carrier system for home banking and other high security applications until it was finally switched off in 2007.</p>\n<p>As Bildschirmtext was a centralized system operated by the federal Deutsche Bundespost on mainframe systems, much of the content that was available has been lost.  A couple of the original data files of the Chaos Computer Club have survived, however, and as the CCC became notorious in the context of Bildschirmtext, that content made for an entertaining exercise in re-engineering.</p>\n<p>In the talk, I will present my journey as a recent Bildschirmtext enthusiast.

      "abstract": "<p>With rise in organizations adopting the open data lakehouse architecture, the ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly. Even as industry vendors attempt to standardize around a replacement for good-old Hive, users continue to choose specific table formats such as Apache Hudi, Iceberg, or Delta Lake, for their strengths around specific workloads. New open table formats and columnar file formats optimized for streaming or unstructured data all continue to emerge and recently a crop of new open-source data catalogs have also been gaining mindshare.</p>\n<p>These developments underscore the need an interoperability standard for the open data lakehouse, to ensure all the pieces fit with each other without any lockin to any one format, catalog or compute engine. Apache XTable, an open-source project currently incubating under the Apache Software Foundation, addresses this challenge by enabling interoperability across table formats without the need to rewrite any data files, ensuring that each format‚Äôs benefits remain accessible within a unified lakehouse setup.</p>\n<p>This talk will go over XTable's architecture and its capabilities, designed to support omnidirectional translation between open table formats. By utilizing shared metadata information, XTable enables continuous metadata translation across these formats, allowing data to be accessed by various compute engines and workflows without duplication or extensive rewrites. Unlike one-off conversions, XTable‚Äôs continuous metadata updates enable seamless translation of new commits incrementally, which can be beneficial at scale. Moving up a layer, we will then show how to synchronize XTable across multiple open-source and proprietary data catalogs to manage permissions and access control policies. This finally makes it easy for users to bring the best-of-breed compute engines to their data easily. </p>\n<p>Finally, we‚Äôll present lessons learned and updates from the community on various deployment options for XTable for example using Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) and AWS Lambda, or how Microsoft Fabric and Snowflake are pursuing interoperability with XTable.</p>\n<p>project: https://github.com/apache/incubator-xtable</p>"

One especially tricky part is the cancellation of POSIX syscalls when they are interrupted by signals, and the intricacies of EINTR side effects. Monolithic kernels inheritely have the bookkeeping required to implement this without  extra overhead. In contrast, due to the generally distributed nature of microkernels, properly cancelling syscalls requires extra work. This is especially the case for Managarm, where (1) POSIX is implemented in a userspace server, (2) syscalls are asynchronous and (3) can involve multiple servers.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will explore the process of implementing syscall cancellation on Managarm. A brief overview of signal delivery is given, followed by a deep dive into the new lifetime of a Managarm POSIX request. Finally, we give a summary of the lessons learned while implementing cancellation in a fully asynchronous microkernel.</p>"

Now, with active involvement of Alliander we are extending the approach towards automation logic for charging, thermostats and home batteries. We will share the forecasting and optimisation methods we are using for combining automation with the original gamification.</p>\n<p>The next challenge is to enable users to participate in additional markets at the same time without creating conflicts: dynamic tariffs, energy sharing and even seasonal storage. With that in mind we started a pilot with the City of The Hague and DSO Stedin combining household participation in reducing net congestion with optimising shared assets such as district batteries and public charging. Jointly we started a collaboration with GOPACS (the Dutch congestion management portal) to enable the energy community of residents to trade, a first of it's kind.

      "abstract": "<p>Intel provided a reference protocol for embedding Intel SGX attestation in the X.509 certificate to establish a TLS-based trusted channel named RA-TLS. This protocol does not use the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) architecture of the X.509 certificate; instead, it relies solely on attestation quote verification to verify the binding between X.509 certificate to the Intel SGX root-of-trust. It may not always be desirable, as quote verification is relatively more expensive compared to certificate chain verification with PKI in place. Moreover, Intel reference implementation for DCAP requires additional infrastructure, including Provisioning Certificate Caching Services (PCCS), which the Intel DCAP reference implementation is tightly coupled with. </p>\n<p>In this talk, we present TC4SE, previously published in the Information Security Conference 2023, which proposed a mechanism to bind SGX root-of-trust primitives with PKI root-of-trust to establish trusted channel. We also present some alternative mechanisms to eliminate the dependency on the web-based PCCS server when developing an Intel SGX application that requires quote generation and verification.</p>"

Private data holds immense value not only for businesses but also for critical research domains like public health, economics, social sciences, and civic engagement. However, leveraging such data for analytics comes with significant privacy risks. ManaTEE aims to address these challenges by integrating a set of Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PETs), including confidential computing, to safeguard data privacy without compromising usability. The framework provides an interactive interface through JupyterLab, ensuring an intuitive experience for researchers and data scientists. We will showcase how Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) ensure both data confidentiality and execution integrity, fostering trust between data owners and analysts. Furthermore, we will highlight how confidential computing can offer additional properties such as proof of execution, enabling researchers to demonstrate the reproducibility and integrity of their results through attestation. Finally, we discuss how ManaTEE simplifies deployment across various confidential computing backends, making secure and private data analytics both accessible and scalable for diverse use cases.</p>"

The pre-commercial phase is covered, which includes early marine radar trackballs, Douglas Engelbart's wheel mouse, and Rollkugel ball mouse. The commercial phase is tracked through the following personally studied devices: early Xerox mice with mechanical and optical encoders, Mouse Systems' design with a simplified optical encoder and reflective mouse pad, Depraz and Apple mice that commercialized the optomechanical encoder, the returns to  Engelbart's original approaches in 1980s analog mice for home computers and wheel mice such as Torrington/Numonics Manager mouse and Hawley DEC mouse, and, finally, the first optical trackball encoder in the Logitech Trackman. Considered connection methods include parallel, serial, serial bus, and analog ones. The evolution of the shape is represented by the first officially ergonomic devices (Microsoft \"Dove bar\" mouse and  ITAC Systems MOUSE-TRAK trackball), and the ProAgio Scroll mouse that started the wheel scrolling revolution. Surprisingly, all mice and trackballs covered in the talk can be connected to modern computers using open-source converters, which are also examined and discussed.</p>"

While traditional bitwise implementations are slow and less efficient, alternative methods such as lookup tables, carry-less multiplication, and hardware CRC instructions offer significant performance improvements. In this talk, I will present a novel method for automatically identifying and replacing inefficient bitwise CRC implementations with optimized alternatives. The approach uses fast detection of candidate code fragments, symbolic execution for validation, and automatic replacement with more efficient implementations.  The method is implemented in the GCC compiler as a separate pass and is open-source available. Experimental evaluation was performed for i386, AArch64, and RISC-V architectures, and the results demonstrated up to 91%, 98%, and 93% performance improvements respectively, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed optimization.</p>"

In a tech world built on start-ups, venture capital and data-gathering apps, the fight for sustainable funding for ethical technology projects is a fierce one. After some big victories for FOSS funding in the last years, this talk is about the importance of not forgetting the small, underdog civil society projects.</p>\n<p>How do we fund technology in a sustainable way? Fund infrastructure, fund maintenance, fund that project some random person in Nebraska has been thanklessly maintaining since 2003. While infrastructure is extremely important (no questions asked), in this talk we want to explore why a diverse funding landscape that also allows for supporting new people and groups with fresh ideas can only be incredibly valuable to the field of FOSS.</p>\n<p>How can we use existing funding structures, bend and twist them to meet the real needs of communities? How can we make them more useful to projects and people who are not typically the recipients of their money? We want to talk about how to build support infrastructure that allows us to fund in ways that bring more diversity, more novel ideas and more inclusivity to our communities - and we want to talk about how to do this in a sustainable way. </p>\n<p>The background to this talk is our experience in managing the German FOSS Prototype Fund, which has funded nearly 400 projects over the past eight years together with the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Following an extensive internal and external evaluation, and as the initial funding was coming to an end, we spent the last year designing and setting up a new, more sustainable funding structure for early-stage projects. </p>\n<p>This talk is a call to government institutions, funders and other organisations with the power to distribute money to join forces, break down the barriers of their traditional funding models and create a broad and vibrant network of small, diverse and lightweight funds that meet the needs of different groups and communities. It is an invitation to communities to come together and share their needs in order to help build structures that can actually support their work. There is hope in FOSS projects, old and new, big and small. Let's hack all kinds of systems to give them the support they need.</p>"

Its purpose is to detail both the technical pipeline and the socio-institutional setting that made it possible to emerge, highlighting the challenges of developing open tools for closed sources.</p>\n<p>The French web archives is an institutional repository of data maintained by the French National Library (BnF). It contains more than 2 petabytes of data spanning over close to 30 years, which accounts to more than 50 billion web pages. Access to this data is restricted under the heritage and legal deposit law: academic researchers willing to work on web archives as data are expected to submit research projects that, upon a formal or informal agreement, will enable them to access this data. But what then?\nBuilding the methodological means to pursue epistemological goals in that context is particularly challenging. Web archivists do provide toolkits for exploration. Recent initiatives have scaled up the effort to make these sources more accessible. The RESPADON project has successfully managed to build a ‚Äúcaptive web archive‚Äù capacity into the Hyphe software, and in doing so has opened a new way into developing tools for such data.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we will present a new solution to extensively study, at the qualitative level, specific topics in the full-text indexed collections of the French web archives. Built around the PANDOR√Ü software, this pipeline has been designed to interrogate the captive data source on site, but also extract relevant metadata in a compliant manner to enable its exploration off-site, while ensuring reproducibility by publishing the code. In doing so, this pipeline provides an up-to-date example of the ‚Äúone-way mirror‚Äù situation of building open tools that are fit to operate on closed data sources.</p>"

It works by pre-generating a merkle tree of hashes for the target/data block device and then by supplying the root hash to the kernel during the mount operation. This enables a form of integrity checking which is \"delayed\" in the sense that checks are done by the kernel using the merkle tree and the root hash during individual block accesses, instead of having to hash and verify the entire block device before mounting; which is prohibited in some use cases (i.e during boot).</p>\n<p>Snaps are mostly well-known as a packaging and distribution format for Linux applications but are also used in Ubuntu Core, which is Ubuntu's immutable OS variant, to ship core parts of the system such as the Linux kernel or the rootfs. Storage-wise, each snap is essentially a squashfs read-only file system which is mounted during its installation. While checks are already in place for verifying the integrity of snaps in use, we are looking into improving the existing mechanisms by allowing snaps to be mounted with dm-verity. This should allow for more performant integrity checking prior to use (or during boot in the case of Ubuntu Core) as well as continuous integrity checking during runtime. This talk will present some of our design challenges, a few interesting applications (i.e in secure boot and confidential computing) and the current state of the project.</p>"

Finally I will compare how the GraalVM native-image AOT code differs from the JIT code of HotSpot.</p>"

At this stage, the vTPM in Coconut SVSM is ephemeral, being re-manufactured with each boot. To unlock broader use cases, the community is working on introducing a persistent state for SVSM, enabling the vTPM to preserve its state across reboots. This enhancement will also allows us to support UEFI variable store to support Secure Boot.</p>\n<p>Achieving this persistence requires storing encrypted state securely on the untrusted host, with early boot-time attestation to decrypt and validate the state.

When looking at emissions over the lifespan of devices, the vast majority of CO2 (85+%) comes from production, not usage.</p>\n<p>Moving to a circular economy can reduce the disproportionate energy consumption and CO2 emissions associated with hardware manufacturing. Hardware and software are inextricably linked, and a Free Software license disrupts the produce-use-dispose linear model of hardware and enable the shift to a reduce-reuse-recycle circular model. In this talk I provide an overview of the environmental harm driven by both hardware and software and how FOSS is well-positioned to address the issues. I will link the inherent values that come with a Free &amp; Open Source Software license to sustainable software design.

This assessment considers whether companies are releasing statements that meet the legal requirements, but also if they detail policies and actions that go beyond compliance to enable businesses to better respond to modern slavery. Key to this initiative is its open, collaborative approach, and therefore, a set of accessible metrics on Wikirate that empowers non-expert researchers to contribute meaningfully. Through the project, volunteers and researchers have conducted an in-depth analysis of over 2000 MSA statements. Over the years, the project has mobilized thousands of volunteers and engaged over 20 universities worldwide, using Wikirate‚Äôs crowdsourcing platform to organize and perform research at scale. The insights generated through the research not only inform Walk Free‚Äôs advocacy efforts with governments and companies but also demonstrate the power of open research principles in tackling complex global issues.</p>"

      "abstract": "<p>This presentation introduces Active Tigger, an open-source research tool designed to accelerate collaborative text annotation in the social sciences.</p>\n<p>The increasing use of text-as-data in social science research has created a pressing need for efficient annotation tools. While small datasets can be manually annotated, the exponential growth in available textual data (e.g., from newspapers and social media) demands solutions that enable collaborative annotation and automation. Moreover, the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of robust corpus annotation practices, particularly for evaluating prompt-engineered outputs from LLM-as-a-service platforms like OpenAI or Hugging Face.</p>\n<p>To address these challenges, we created an annotation platform, Active Tigger. A first version was developed in 2022 using R and RShiny (J. Boelaert, GitLab Repository). This tool embeds several annotation heuristics, including active learning‚Äîiteratively predicting and selecting annotations to maximize training quality‚Äîto help researchers build training datasets in order to fine-tuning encoder models. The tool quickly became integral to the research team's activities and beyond, which incited us to develop of a second, more robust version.</p>\n<p>The current iteration of Active Tigger, built with a Python-based API and a React frontend, introduces enhanced flexibility and scalability. It supports collaborative workflows, accommodates a broader range of use cases, and is now in beta testing, with early adopters exploring its potential.</p>\n<p>This presentation will cover three key aspects:</p>\n<p>The journey of Active Tigger: From addressing specific social science needs to adapting to the evolving landscape of LLMs.\nShowcase: Demonstrating the annotation workflow using active learning and BERT fine-tuning.\nFuture directions: Exploring the tool's evolution in the context of widespread LLM availability, discussing the trade-offs between focusing on specialized tasks and enabling broader applications.</p>\n<p>Github repository of Active Tigger : https://github.com/emilienschultz/activetigger</p>"

I show benchmarks comparing GNU Radio 3.10, GNU Radio 4.0, FutureSDR, this new runtime, and a hand-written ad-hoc implementation, for a class of certain simple flowgraphs. These show that popular runtimes often have a high overhead and that there is much room for improvements in performance.

Particularly, domestic small and midsize entrepreneurs find themselves hands-tied in their quest to digitize and optimize their operations, allowing them to scale and reach more unserved rural communities. The integrations with different energy asset communications and the integrations with payment providers (e.g., mobile money, which is widely used) come with significant efforts for these small-size companies. Therefore, we see an enormous value (in supporting bottom-up, locally driven rural electrification) in the provision and maintenance of the Open Source MicroPowerManager, where all those integrations and interopearbilities need to be set up only on time and benefit a variety of domestic companies and initiatives.

In many regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, weakly-connected mini-grids present a promising solution; however, their operation is often constrained, if not undermined, by uncertainties in energy demand, renewable production, and frequent grid outages. Addressing these challenges requires advanced optimization techniques to ensure reliable, cost-effective energy access.</p>\n<p>The Autarky model, developed in Julia, offers an innovative approach to optimizing the economic dispatch of renewable-powered, weakly-connected mini-grids under uncertainty. By integrating Joint Chance Constraints (JCC), the model ensures robust operation during outages and renewable variability while maintaining reliability at a predefined probability level. It addresses four key uncertainties: solar power forecasting errors, load demand forecasting errors, and the timing and duration of main grid outages. The model strategically schedules diesel generators and battery reserves to maximize operational efficiency and guarantee energy supply even during grid disruptions.\nAutarky is benchmarked against three alternative approaches ‚Äî Individual Chance Constraints (ICC), an Expected-Value Model (EVM), and a Regular deterministic model ‚Äî to evaluate the trade-offs between reliability and cost. The framework is validated through a real-world case study of a mini-grid in Lake Victoria, Tanzania. Results demonstrate that the JCC model achieves a 90% probability of successful islanding with 3-hour daily grid outages, significantly enhancing reliability compared to ICC (58%) and EVM (20%), while leading to a 25% reduction in profit.</p>\n<p>Key contributions of this work include:\n‚Ä¢   A stochastic optimization framework tailored for weakly-connected mini-grids, integrating multivariate Gaussian distributions through spherical-radial decomposition.\n‚Ä¢   A comparative analysis of dispatch strategies, quantifying the trade-offs between cost and reliability across different models.\n‚Ä¢   A practical case study using real-world data from Tanzania, validating the model's effectiveness in addressing uncertainties and improving energy access.\nBy fostering open-source collaboration, Autarky aspires to accelerate the global deployment of resilient mini-grids, thereby contributing to universal clean energy access and the realization of the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7). </p>\n<p>The model is openly accessible on GitHub. \nLink: https://github.com/Autarky-Power/Minigrid-JCC/</p>"

These registries are always within reach of developers thanks to command-line package managers like npm and pip, enabling rapid testing and deployment of third-party code as part of normal workflows.  However, these benefits come at the cost of particular security concerns: threat actors routinely target software developers via open-source package registries, either by publishing backdoored packages or by taking over and corrupting legitimate software. In many such supply-chain attacks, merely installing the malicious package is enough to hand control of one‚Äôs system over to the adversary.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we lay out the strategies that threat actors use when targeting software developers via open-source package registries.  We do so by examining case-studies in open-source malware delivery via npm and PyPI, some involving nation-state actors, that we at Datadog Security Research have collected while continuously monitoring these ecosystems with GuardDog, an open-source scanner for identifying malicious packages by analyzing code patterns and package metadata.  We then propose recommendations for developers, as well as for the package registries themselves, to counter these strategies that could lead to a greater overall level of software supply-chain security in the open-source community.</p>"

ACME protocol combined with the new features incorporated in the last release of mod_md make it so easy to have a completely automated environment to manage the renewal of the certificates of your webservers. Using the ACME feature of FreeIPA integrated with mod_md you can manage multiple security sites in a  completely automated and scalable way without any external dependencies so you will never need to be concerned about common topics such as: when to perform the operation, possible disruptions, long times waiting for the CA to sign your certificates or any kind of problems you experienced in the past. Mod_md also includes several fine tuning mechanisms about when to perform the operations to make the server aware of any issue in your certs.  We will also review them and this combined with appropriate monitoring reduces the renewal operation to the minimum.</p>\n<p>Whether you manage Kubernetes, hybrid infrastructure, or standalone systems, FreeIPA offers a flexible and scalable approach to SSL/TLS management. Join us to uncover how FreeIPA‚Äôs ACME support can transform your certificate lifecycle management, improving security posture with minimal complexity no matter your applications are running on top of Kubernetes or on Apache.

And the size of the TCB directly influences the speed at which new releases and bug fixes are deployed to production, since reviews take a lot of time. So low-TCB environments are a desired solution that many teams try to achieve.\nBut even the main security features needed to implement a trusted workload, such as end-to-end encryption, require significant increases in the TCB. For example, more general approaches like TLS with an extensive feature set including support for many signature schemes, certificate parsing and session resumption logic may be less ideal for low-TCB environments.\nTo address this issue we will present a remote attestation scheme that uses Noise Protocol Framework to create an end-to-end encrypted attested channel between an end-user device and a TEE. Noise Protocol Framework allows us to minimize the amount of crypto primitives needed and only leave the logic that is necessary to establish an encrypted session and to bind it to the attestation evidence.\nDuring this talk we will also present an open-source implementation of our approach written in Rust.</p>"

So this talk may be an interesting opportunity for discussion to influence the future development of your preferred virtualization solution.</p>"

However, alongside its transformative potential, voluntary data sharing in the public interest, or data donation, is plagued by systemic issues, ranging from lack of trust and privacy breaches to legal uncertainty, undermining its intended role as a democratizing force. </p>\n<p>Recognizing this brokenness, we turn to the concept of digital repair as a lens through which to understand and address these deficiencies. Drawing from social innovation and data governance theories, this abstract advances the sociology of repair centered on the concept of data altruism, the new EU framework for voluntary data sharing for objectives of general interest, including scientific research purposes. This talk explores the potential of data donation as a means to not only rectify the fractures in the digital data ecosystem, but also to stimulate a more socially sustainable data economy. </p>\n<p>By conceptualizing data donation within the framework of sociology of repair, this talk proposes its implications for reframing data agency, and advancing notions of digital constitutionalism. This talk is explicitly an effort to facilitate discussion about useful and plausible conceptual tools to theorize data donation. Through an ethnographically-informed investigation, this talk contributes to an understanding of the infrastructure enabling data altruism for scientific research purposes in the Netherlands, offering insights that are fruitful for navigating future research journeys into the European data economy.</p>"

      "abstract": "<p>In the field of semiconductor technology, compact modeling, and IC designs, the OpenPDK Initiative provides an international platform for discussing advanced technologies, fostering collaboration among industry and academic leaders in electronic design automation (EDA). We review selected R\\&amp;D topics presented at a recent event by prominent academic researchers and industrial professionals who presented and discussed innovative approaches in CAD/EDA tools, techniques including compact/SPICE modeling, and IC design that address the demands of emerging semiconductor technology applications. However, the semiconductor industry also faces many challenges in maintaining the growth of its workforce with skilled technicians and engineers. To address the increasing need for well-trained workers worldwide, we must find innovative ways to attract skilled talent and strengthen the local semiconductor workforce ecosystem. The FOSS CAD/EDA tools with the recently available open access PDKs provide a new platform to connect IC design beginners, enthusiasts and experienced mentors to benefit from the collaboration opportunities enabled by the fast-growing open-source IC design movement. The collaborative development of open-source integrated circuit (IC) designs is becoming increasingly feasible due to the rapid expansion of OpenPDKs recently offered by SkyWater, GF and IHP with an open schedule of MPW Runs for FMD-QNC project in 2024-25. This paper demonstrates the FOSS CAD/EDA contribution to the SPICE/Verilog-A modeling/standardization, compete IC design flow (Xschem, Qucs-S, ngspice, Xyce, OpenVAF, OpenEMS, Magic, kLayout, OpenRoad), in addition selected, open-source examples of analog/RF and digital IC designs will be presented.</p>"

However, as open source grows, there is a risk of it becoming another siloed institution, disconnected from the very communities it seeks to serve, much like academia and corporate America. To ensure open source remains inclusive and impactful, we must actively involve local communities in the process of technological development.  </p>\n<p>This talk explores how regional OSPO (Open Source Program Office) networks can serve as catalysts for inclusive innovation by connecting local communities, tech meetups, academic institutions, and civic organizations. These networks create a framework to:<br />\n- Study problems affecting local communities.<br />\n- Develop open technologies tailored to address these issues.<br />\n- Implement solutions through open governance, ensuring transparency, equity, and sustainability.  </p>\n<p>By dedicating resources to both regional collaboration and local focus, regional OSPO networks strike a balance that drives large-scale innovation while staying grounded in the needs of diverse communities.  </p>\n<p>Key themes include:<br />\n- <strong>Open Source as a Societal Institution:</strong> Why open source must go beyond code and actively integrate with local communities to avoid becoming siloed.<br />\n- <strong>Regional Networks for Connection:</strong> How regional OSPO networks foster collaboration among civic institutions, academia, local communities, and the tech industry.<br />\n- <strong>Inclusive Technology Development:</strong> How to engage local voices to study problems, co-develop solutions, and ensure equitable implementation.<br />\n- <strong>The 20/80 Framework:</strong> A practical model for balancing local focus with regional collaboration to create resilient and impactful networks.  </p>\n<p>This session offers a vision for a new kind of open source ecosystem‚Äîone that connects society‚Äôs diverse sectors, tackles real-world problems, and builds a foundation for sustainable, community-driven innovation. Whether you‚Äôre a community leader, OSPO practitioner, or open source advocate, join us to explore how we can bridge the gap between open source ideals and societal impact.  </p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong><br />\n- The importance of integrating local communities into open source development processes.<br />\n- How regional OSPO networks can address local challenges through collaborative innovation.<br />\n- Strategies for fostering open governance and inclusive technology development.  </p>\n<p>This talk is a call to action: let‚Äôs ensure open source remains a force for collective good, bringing all of society into the fold.

For example, the specification outlines the steps that drivers must follow to initialize a device. If a driver makes any incorrect sequence, the device returns an error.\nWhile the driver or device may not always conform to the spec, deviations can lead to unexpected behaviors or bugs. In this presentation, we introduce two tools to check whether a VirtIO device conforms to the specification. Firstly, we present Kani - a tool developed by Amazon that is used to verify conformance in devices implemented in Firecracker. Secondly, we discuss an experimental tool that validates conformance during the execution of the device. This is a Rust tracer that developers can add to an existing device to ensure its implementation conforms to the specification. Traces are compared with the specification at runtime to detect any violations that may have occurred.</p>"

Conventional approaches to Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) often require specialized hardware or substantial system resources, leaving low-end devices vulnerable to breaches. The need for a lightweight, efficient solution that bridges this gap is greater than ever in today‚Äôs interconnected world.  </p>\n<h2>Introducing Spock</h2>\n<p>Through the development of Spock, we have created a versatile and efficient Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) tailored for RISC-V embedded devices. By relying solely on Physical Memory Protection (PMP) for isolation and requiring only machine and user modes as specified in the RISC-V privileged instruction set, Spock delivers robust security without relying on any specialized hardware.  </p>\n<p>At the core of Spock‚Äôs architecture is the <strong>Security Manager (SM)</strong>, which plays a key role in managing enclave data and buffer permissions. The SM enables Spock to efficiently virtualize buffers and dynamically allocate PMP entries, providing a flexible and scalable approach to memory isolation. By leveraging this abstraction, Spock can create virtual enclaves that surpass hardware-imposed limitations, such as the number of PMP entries.  </p>\n<h2>Core Features and Capabilities</h2>\n<p>Spock‚Äôs minimalist API design delivers essential security functions, including secure execution and attestation. This design supports:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Virtualization of critical operations while maintaining a minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).  </li>\n<li>Integration into very low resource embedded devices. </li>\n<li>Both relocatable and fixed enclaves, offering flexibility for diverse use cases.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why Spock Matters</h2>\n<p>Spock‚Äôs design represents a modern, efficient solution for secure computing in low-resource embedded devices. Its ability to combine robust security with minimal hardware requirements makes it uniquely suited for the demands of today‚Äôs connected world, ensuring that even the smallest devices can operate securely.</p>\n<p>Available at : https://github.com/jiphelsen/Spock</p>"

A typical output of such models is an estimate of the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, a measure of the economic damage caused over its lifetime by a ton of greenhouse gas such as CO2 or CH4. </p>\n<p>META, however, computes many other economic as well as geophysical indicators. As its name suggests, META was built specifically to estimate the economic impact of tipping points in the climate system. To do so, META incorporates different tipping points modules, each of which replicate a geophysically realistic tipping point module from a study in the climate economics research literature. </p>\n<p>META was originally introduced in Dietz, Rising, Stoerk and Wagner (2021, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2103081118), and has since been updated and ported to Julia using the Mimi Framework. Follow-up research has improved several components of META. Similarly, META estimates have been used to inform conversations with authorities in the EU and the US. </p>\n<p>In this talk, I will give a short overview of META's structure, its capabilities, and ideas for the community on how to further improve and use META for open research in the future. </p>\n<p>META is freely available on Github under a GPL-3.0 copyleft licence: https://github.com/openmodels/META</p>"

Many closed-source enterprises are competing to provide solutions in this space, but the commercial path to scale is difficult, with many startups running out of funding before their product hits the market. When they‚Äôre in business, there is little transparency or external validation of their development process, and if they go out of business, the wider community learns little from their failures.</p>\n<p>We will present our efforts as part of the Flow Battery Research Collective (FBRC) to develop an open-source battery technology for stationary applications. FBRC is developing a battery designed for stationary energy storage use at the residential scale, that aims to be cheaper, safer, longer lasting, more sustainable, and more recyclable than current technologies. We‚Äôll give a quick overview of existing battery technologies and cover the fundamentals of the technology we are working with‚Äîflow batteries‚Äîand why we picked this technology. </p>\n<p>We‚Äôll cover our progress so far, our roadmap, and how we plan to integrate with the many open-source power electronics and battery/energy management systems that exist on the other side of our development gap. Network-connected batteries need secure software/firmware to operate safely; we will go over some ways in which a (flow) battery could be abused if a bad actor were able to control the system remotely.

Designed primarily for geographers and cartographers, CartABl also serves broader communities seeking to produce interactive cartographic content. It addresses the technical barrier that coding poses to creating interactive cartographic content (using js) through a graphical interface for defining interactions. It integrates seamlessly with traditional workflows by enhancing maps created in vector graphics editors like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator with interactivity, without requiring programming knowledge. CartABl leverages SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) as its base format, embedding interactive rules as declarative elements interpreted by a lightweight JavaScript runtime. This results in standalone, browser-compatible interactive SVG files, preserving the scalability and versatility of the format.</p>\n<p>The development of CartABl follows an instrumental genesis approach, where tool and user co-evolve through iterative feedback. Initial prototypes allowed basic interactivity like tooltips and layer toggling. Feedback from its application in projects such as L‚ÄôAtlas Bleu, a journal focused on coastal and marine maps, guides its refinement. This iterative process not only improves the tool but also influences how cartographers structure and design their graphical maps and figures: the structure of the graphical objects must be adapted to facilitate the definition of interaction rules, and the interactive features proposed by the tool impact the design decisions of the users.</p>\n<p>CartABl aims to democratize interactive cartography, making it accessible and intuitive for professionals and non-experts alike. By transforming workflows and expanding the possibilities of digital cartographic publishing, it stands out as a valuable resource for advancing geographic and graphic research and communication.</p>"

But there is a potential chicken-and-egg problem: Should the OEMs support it first, or are they waiting for widespread support of the protocol in EMS implementations (who are hesitant if the OEMs don't support it)?</p>\n<p>The only forward is to start showing real solutions and implementations with front-runners from both sides. Then, these smaller showcases can become an avalanche and lift the sector up in an open way. Both steps are difficult and need partnerships.</p>\n<p>Energy flexibility optimization behind the meter is already deployed in practice. However, networking protocols and definitions of flexibility are used which are not standardized and not openly available. This makes building new solutions with new flexible energy assets (like EVs, batteries, heat pumps and also solar inverters) a chore and drives up costs. Each new energy asset (or new brand) has to be integrated with their specific protocols and patterns. New protocols attempt to standardize these concepts, such as the S2 protocol. It targets an international audience for both existing and new/future energy assets. See https://s2standard.org/ </p>\n<p>S2 is approved as European standard, but the next batteline is to showcase that implementations can work and that both sides, OEMs and EMS, are willing to get to work. Open source implementations will provide building blocks and serve as reference.</p>\n<p>This presentation will show the efforts and experiences of two different consortia, from different implementation projects, with adopting the protocol and creating tools to spur adoption by other innovators and OEMs. Of course, we will also briefly outline the protocol itself, and address differences and shared features in other existing protocols in this space, like EEBus and OpenADR.</p>\n<p>We hope this talk can spur more interest and collaboration in this space and towards a lift for open efforts in the industry. </p>\n<p>Join our presentation if you want to learn more about protocol standardization efforts within the energy transition and S2 specifically!</p>"

      "abstract": "<p>While containers have been pivotal in cloud computing, offering isolated environments for applications, they bring notable drawbacks. These include substantial overhead, resulting in larger, less efficient deployments and startup times, and a dependency on the underlying OS for security, posing potential vulnerabilities. </p>\n<p>WebAssembly (Wasm) addresses these challenges, and this talk will introduce the open-source project Boxer (https://boxer.dev), which offers tooling for taking existing containerized workloads and definitions, and creating near-universally deployable Wasm distributions (‚ÄúBoxes‚Äù) offering roughly the same environment, with all the benefits of the WebAssembly target. Wasm, a compact binary instruction format, enables lightweight, sandboxed execution,  significantly reducing overhead compared to traditional containers. This leads to enhanced performance and smaller, more efficient deployments, ideal for cloud computing. Additionally, Wasm's memory-safe, isolated execution environment provides superior security, independent of the OS. Thus, Wasm, with its blend of efficiency and security, emerges as not just an alternative, but a substantial improvement over container technology for cloud deployments.</p>\n<p>With the main tools built in Rust, importantly, Marcotte (https://github.com/dphilla/marcotte) -- the underlying tool for virtualizing layers of system functionality -- allows us to make safe, sandboxed, discrete, and composable system functionality, by leveraging Rust's memory safety model, and the inherent properties of WebAssembly. </p>\n<p>This talk will critically examine this new technology, its approach, benefits, and existing limitations compared with containers, and its path forward as a new standard in cloud infrastructure.</p>"

You‚Äôre not alone.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we want to provide a simple, practical, and proven approach to writing governance that‚Äôs directly inspired from coding best practices. The very same concepts that are used when writing code (e.g. Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself, Keep It Simple, or Separation of Concerns) have direct application when authoring governance documents and create the same kind of positive outcomes: governance that is simple to understand, flexible, and and easy to maintain. You‚Äôll never come back from thinking about governance as code.</p>\n<p>By the time you leave this presentation, you‚Äôll have an entirely new perspective on governance and will feel empowered by your ability to leverage your existing software engineering skills in this new domain.</p>"

Motivated by the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, our team from Georgia Tech's Master in Computer Science program, with early guidance from researchers at Robert Gordon University, created PICO Scholar. This AI-powered platform helps researchers by turning their queries into embeddings, matching them with a semantic vector database, and pulling out important research details‚ÄîPopulation, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO). It ranks relevant studies and offers a chatbot powered by RAG for exploring documents more deeply. Future updates aim to add features for real-time collaboration, making it easier for teams to work together on reviewing literature.</p>\n<p>PICO Scholar uses a solid microservices setup with Red Hat OpenShift AI, boosted by Intel‚Äôs OpenVINO toolkit. It runs models like SciBERT for embeddings and TinyLlama for generating text, managed by ModelMesh. LlamaIndex organizes embeddings into a TiDB VectorStore for smarter searches, and fine-tuned adapters improve accuracy for specific fields. MinIO S3 supports smooth model storage, and the platform‚Äôs microservice design makes it scalable and resource-efficient.</p>\n<p>What makes PICO Scholar stand out is not just its technology but its focus on community and collaboration. Built during two hackathons - including a 2nd place win at the Red Hat &amp; Intel AI Hackathon - with changing team members and diverse skills, the project follows open-source principles, encouraging contributions from all backgrounds. Our goal is to make powerful research tools accessible to everyone, helping researchers worldwide speed up discoveries. By continuing to improve PICO Scholar, we hope to support the scientific community and build a platform that grows and evolves to meet its needs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/datagero/pico-scholar\">PICO Scholar GitHub repository</a></p>"

Instead of just calling for more funding for open source, public digital infrastructure, digital commons, etc, the talk will concretely compare proposed funding approaches, discuss the practicalities of an institution like the EU investing in FOSS maintenance and security, and examine how the funding might be delivered in the next Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>\n<p>The second part of the talk will highlight the opportunity for a Sovereign Tech Agency at the EU level which plays a greater role in funding the maintenance and security of FOSS. The German government's support to build the Sovereign Tech Fund, now the Sovereign Tech Agency, has received a lot of attention in Europe and globally for its ability to support and invest in the FOSS ecosystem. This talk will present an initial legal analysis for what an EU-scale Sovereign Tech Fund could look like, in consideration of three different potential institutional set-ups: (2) one EU funding body to rule them all, (2) a federated set up with a coordinating body/system, and (3) a free for all for all Member States to set up their own funding bodies. It will then consider the next steps for developing a more comprehensive feasibility assessment of this topic and making the case for FOSS funding to policymakers in the European Commission.</p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions continuously monitor the events occurring on an endpoint, create detailed process timelines, and analyse these data, to reveal suspicious patterns that could indicate threats such as ransomware. To create these detailed timelines, EDR solutions collect a variety of information about each process running on the endpoint, such as timestamp, PID, process name, path, command line, etc. On Linux systems, this is often done using the proc filesystem provided by the operating system, which provides rich information for each process currently running on the system.\nHowever, if a process is short-lived and exits quickly, the proc filesystem entries for it get cleared out before the EDR solution can read them, leading to incomplete timelines. To take a simple example, suppose a malicious actor runs a script that downloads a binary from the network and then executes it. This downloaded binary quickly spawns a bunch of long-running malicious processes and exits itself. If EDR solution is unable to extract the complete process information about the execution of the downloaded binary from proc filesystem (being a short-lived process), it'll miss details about the creator of the malicious process in the system. Hence, EDR solution will have visibility gaps about the downloaded binary required for Security Threat Analysis. \nWe propose a solution to address the gaps by attaching extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) programs dynamically to the Linux kernel system calls (such as fork, exec and exit) and extracting all the required information directly from the kernel hooks using BPF Type Format (BTF). These hooks use fundamental task structure in kernel representing a process or thread to extract variety of information about the process. Our proof of concept shows that eBPF-based process data extraction provides process timelines with near 100% reliability, compared to proc filesystem-based approaches which have a reliability of only around 83% for short lived processes.</p>"

These initiatives aim to make civic tech and open-source tools more accessible in Taiwan while enabling international projects to take root and thrive locally.</p>\n<p>As a coordinator, OCF has completely localized projects such as GOV.UK Notify, GOV.UK Forms, Matrix Client (Element Series), IRMA, Yivi, Standard for Public Code, Bitwarden, Nextcloud, FreeOTP, GIMP, and Mattermost.

OCF also developed a collaborative glossary process to bridge communication gaps among stakeholders and ensure consistent terminology usage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Collaboration Among Taiwan‚Äôs Communities</strong>\n    Partnering with Taiwan‚Äôs L10N community, OCF established structured review processes to meet the government‚Äôs high standards for quality and timeliness. Over three years, OCF conducted two major surveys during COSCUP. One survey identified critical open-source projects needed in Taiwan, while the other focused on addressing challenges that hinder contributions, aiming to encourage broader participation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Engagement with Local Industry and International Communities</strong>\n    Although Taiwanese tech teams are highly skilled, many are unfamiliar with the culture of open-source contributions. OCF facilitated understanding of licensing, contribution practices, and engagement with upstream communities. For example, OCF helped Mattermost report and resolve a date display bug in Chinese (CJK) scripts and worked with upstream communities to address significant differences between Simplified and Traditional Chinese, including grammar and linguistic nuances.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Localization is not merely about technical translation; it is a strategic approach to connecting governments, communities, and international open-source projects. This talk will share OCF‚Äôs experiences in bridging these gaps and invite Community DevRoom participants to exchange ideas on how to effectively integrate open-source projects into their respective countries.</p>"

Furthermore, they need to be able to reason about the outcome of actions and change their behavior accordingly, to name a few. \nPyCRAM is a framework to design high-level cognition enabled robot behavior, designed to address the aforementioned challenges of deploying robots in human households. This is done by providing tools to define a robot control plan, which is written as high-level human instructions like \"go to the table\" or \"pick up the cup\". PyCRAM is then able to translate these instructions to instructions for a robot while taking the current context the robot is operating in into account.

I'll then present how sq is different\nfrom other tools in the ecosystem.  In this regard, one of the most\nimportant differences is that sq explicitly does not support curated\nkeyrings; users have to authenticate all of the certificates that they\nuse.  At first blush, this may sound like a usability nightmare, but\nI'll show how sq supports users by managing evidence, which simplifies\nthese decisions.  Finally, I'll demonstrate several workflows.  These\ninclude how to verify files, how to create and manage a certificate,\nhow to find a certificate and use it, and how to create and manage a\nCA for your organization.</p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Integrated in the Linux kernel since 2014, eBPF has allowed the creation of a large variety of projects (observability, security, network, etc.). Unlike kernel modules, eBPF programs can be loaded by unprivileged users. The Linux kernel is protected by a static analyzer, called the <a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/verifier.html\">eBPF verifier</a>, which verifies that eBPF programs cannot harm the kernel and respect required security properties. Recently, several research works have shown that the eBPF verifier, which is a critical component, is not sound. This means that programs which should be rejected are accepted by the verifier, allowing unprivileged users to run malicious programs (e.g [<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-37709-9_12\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/jin-di\">2</a>,<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3627703.3629562\">3</a>,<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi24/presentation/sun-hao\">4</a>,<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/lu-hongyi\">5</a>]). In this talk, we propose to evaluate the performance of the eBPF verifier through the measurement of three main aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Performance evaluation: to understand the evolution of the eBPF verifier versions, we evaluated the verification time and consumed memory of six eBPF verifier versions (Linux kernel 5.0 to 6.8, both included). The results show that for some eBPF programs, the verifiers have nearly the same verification times (except for the conditional jumps, where the verification time has decreased since the introduction of the bounded loops in the Linux kernel 5.3). Consumed memory remains also stable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Comparative evaluation with <a href=\"https://vbpf.github.io/\">PREVAIL</a>: as the eBPF verifier is not sound, we compared it to PREVAIL, which is another verifier proposed in 2019 at the PLDI conference. PREVAIL is a sound verifier that runs in user space and is used in the eBPF infrastructure of Windows. On the one hand, we were interested in the implementation differences between the two verification solutions and on the other hand, we observed the performance difference between the two verifiers. We observed that, although PREVAIL's performance has improved, it remains less efficient than the eBPF verifier. Nevertheless, PREVAIL showed that it can efficiently verify programs containing a lot of paths (implied by conditional jumps) thanks to the join operator and the fixpoint computation used for the bounded loops, where the eBPF verifier would have created a lot of paths, trying to reduce them with pruning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Impact of compilers: beyond the verification mechanisms, there are external constraints such as the compilers: An eBPF program is first compiled into eBPF bytecode and then analyzed. However, we observed that for the eBPF verifier with a specific eBPF program, which varies only by its number of loop iterations, Clang-8 produced more programs accepted by the eBPF verifier and these programs are verified faster than those produced by Clang-14.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"

      "abstract": "<p>Heating and cooling account for around 50% of Europe‚Äôs final energy consumption, making renewable heating and cooling technologies a significant lever to reduce carbon emissions. One well established renewable heat technology is solar thermal. Solar thermal systems use solar radiation to heat a working fluid directly, providing a low-cost heat source with a significantly better specific yield per unit of collector area than PV. Solar thermal collectors have been used to supplement domestic hot water heating for decades, but more recently the market for large solar thermal arrays to supply bulk heat to district heating systems or industrial customers has begun to grow significantly. At present long-term monitoring of these systems is carried out using a variety of proprietary tools developed by industry stakeholders ‚Äì with limited agreement on methodology and little transparency on the algorithms being employed ‚Äì or not at all. To address this, the international standard ISO 24194 was published in 2022, providing an open standard for the assessment of the performance of solar thermal arrays in operation. The SunPeek project is the first open-source implementation of this standard and aims to become the reference implementation by providing an open, trusted, user friendly application with well documented design decisions in cases where the standard is ambiguous. SunPeek is designed with highly automated workflows in mind and includes robust data preprocessing and error checking. It also includes several extensions of the ISO methodology to allow valid assessments to be made under a wider range of operating conditions, and funding has been secured to add fault detection, localization and remediation decision support functionality.  </p>\n<p>Several use cases are cases envisioned including: </p>\n<p>Long term automated regular performance assessment. </p>\n<p>performance guarantee verification (a use case which clearly demonstrates the value of being open source, due to verifiability of the codebase) </p>\n<p>Research applications </p>\n<p>Integration into existing fully featured plant monitoring solutions.  </p>\n<p>Different interfaces and packaging formats are provided to support these.  </p>\n<p>The core functionality is written in python, and made available as a package on PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/sunpeek/). </p>\n<p>A set of docker images and a compose configuration allow deployment as a web application with Vue.js based user interface and FastAPI based REST API. </p>\n<p>The project is hosted on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/sunpeek), documentation is at https://docs.sunpeek.org and a demo is available at https://demo.sunpeek.org. </p>\n<p>This work has been supported by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (project HarvestIT, project number FFG 887648, and IEA SHC Task 68, FO999890460) and the European Commission (project IndHeap, proposal number 101136140).</p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Hello, my name is David Berman. I am an electrician by trade, not a programmer by profession, but I have ventured into the world of programming out of necessity and conviction. My journey into this realm has been fueled by a desire to challenge the prevailing norms of an industry heavily skewed toward proprietary, enterprise-oriented solutions. Specifically, I have worked to advocate for open-source, cost-effective methods to control city streetlights and other industrial control systems traditionally dominated by expensive and exclusive technologies.</p>\n<p>During my talk I would like to share my newest project, Gungnir:\nhttps://github.com/davidjrb/gungnir</p>\n<p>This journey has been far from easy. The resistance to change in this space is significant, and the challenges are both technical and cultural. One of the key barriers is the entrenched power of profit-driven opponents, including corporate lobbyists and those with vested interests in maintaining the status quo. These forces often stifle innovation and prevent the adoption of solutions that could benefit society as a whole by reducing costs and fostering collaboration.</p>\n<p>Another challenge comes from within the very community I advocate for. Despite the immense potential of open-source solutions, there is a tendency among many non-programmers‚Äîparticularly those in traditional trades or management roles‚Äîto dismiss these solutions out of hand. This is often due to a lack of familiarity with the technology or misconceptions about its reliability and scalability. Bridging this gap requires not only technical expertise but also the ability to communicate the value and viability of open-source approaches in terms that resonate with a broader audience.</p>\n<p>In my talk, I aim to explore these challenges in depth, sharing insights from my own experience as a non-programmer navigating a highly technical field. I will discuss the hurdles faced by the open-source community when advocating for transparency, collaboration, and cost-efficiency in an industry often resistant to such ideals. I will also highlight strategies to foster greater acceptance and collaboration between open-source advocates and those unfamiliar with or skeptical of these technologies.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, my goal is to spark a dialogue about how we, as a community, can better advocate for open-source solutions in industrial and civic systems, ensuring that they are not only adopted but also embraced as a viable and beneficial alternative to proprietary models. By sharing stories, challenges, and strategies, I hope to inspire others‚Äîwhether programmers, non-programmers, or industry professionals‚Äîto join this important movement.</p>\n<p>Thank you for considering my submission, and I look forward to contributing to this vital conversation.</p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Energy services are highly interconnected with socio-economic development and human well-being. Yet, life without reliable energy is a reality for more than 675 million people globally, while more than 2 billion people use polluting fuels to cook their meals. Addressing the critical challenge of extending energy access to the unserved and underserved communities, more than six decades after full electrification in Europe and the United States, is imperative. Unfortunately, the current trajectory falls short. The latest SDG 7 Tracking Report highlights that the world is off course in achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 by 2030, with 85% of those without electricity residing in Sub-Saharan Africa. The repercussions of this shortfall are significant, with adverse impacts on societies and economies: inadequate healthcare persists, educational institutions struggle to provide quality education, and agricultural and industrial sectors face competitiveness challenges in regions where reliable energy remains elusive. Despite efforts such as grid extension, community-run mini-grids, and individual household solutions, progress has been insufficient because these solutions haven't been delivered at scale, in a coordinated way. We urgently require access to data, analytical tools and innovative strategies to deliver affordable, reliable, and clean energy to those who lack access to it. While existing solutions have primarily focused on supply-side and technology-centric approaches, there's a crucial need to prioritize demand-side perspectives to truly meet the needs of users, whether households or institutions.</p>\n<p>What is the Energy Access Explorer (EAE)? \nTo help address this challenge, WRI, in collaboration with partners has developed the Energy Access Explorer (https://www.energyaccessexplorer.org/; https://github.com/energyaccessexplorer) (EAE), a data-driven, integrated and inclusive approach to achieving universal access to energy for equitable, socio-economic development. EAE is the first, open-source, online and interactive geospatial platform that enables energy planners, clean energy entrepreneurs, donors, and development institutions to identify high-priority areas for energy access interventions. EAE functions also as a dynamic information system, reducing software engineering and data transaction costs for both data providers and users and facilitating data management and governance.  </p>\n<p>Use cases \nWith over 25,000 users, 48% of which are women, EAE users can customize the analysis and identify areas of interest based on their perspective. More specifically, the use of this platform enables the following:</p>\n<p>Energy Planning Agencies improve the ways integrated and inclusive planning is carried out using a data-informed approach. They will explore the potential for grid extension, off grid systems, clean cooking technologies and renewables for expanding energy access where needed the most. Clean Energy Enterprises, especially the ones with limited or no market intelligence / GIS capacity in house, identify new market opportunities. They will access demographic, socio-economic data, consumer ability to pay for energy services combined with information on energy resource availability and power infrastructure to locate priority areas for expanding their businesses.  Service Delivery Institutions in the health, education, productive use of energy, agriculture sectors get a better understanding of energy needs associated to development services. Clean Cooking agencies identify areas where the uptake of clean cooking technologies should be prioritized based on location specific data on demand, supply and environment. Donors and Development Finance Institutions identify areas where their grants and investment will have the most impact.  </p>\n<p>Outcomes to Date\nTo date, EAE has contributed to: the Powering Healthcare Roadmap of the Government of Zambia and the Powering Healthcare initiative of the Health Ministry in Uganda, the development of local, integrated and inclusive County Energy Plans in Kenya, to support the 0.5 billion USD Africa Mini Grid and the Energizing Agriculture Program in Nigeria, to inform the results based financing scheme for off grid electrification in Ethiopia and to establish cross sectoral EAE working groups enabling an integrated and inclusive approach to planning.</p>"

It works by combining outputs from multiple LLMs to solve coding problems without human input. The model breaks tasks into smaller parts, assigns them to the best-suited LLM, and refines the outputs. It evaluates solutions through automated testing and improves by learning from feedback. The system uses a voting mechanism to choose the best output and runs checks for errors and performance issues. Test cases provided by the problems in hacker cup are also generated based on the problem statement and are made to run against the generated code to check for the accuracy.</p>\n<p>This model was a top-10  finalist in Meta's Hacker Cup AI track. It demonstrates a new way of using LLMs to perform end-to-end coding tasks. We will share insights from building and testing the model, including its strengths and challenges.

In order to present that view, Samba requires expensive checks for file\nname lookups to locate a directory entry with the computed case-insensitive\nfolding. It is also necessary to politely handle interoperating with other \nclients that are using normal case-sensitive names. To address this gap, CephFS\nnow provides a mechanism for enforcing case-insensitive operations on a\ndirectory tree for all clients by simply setting a Ceph extended attribute.\nThis talk will walk through the challenges for Samba's gateway on CephFS, the\nchanges to the CephFS metadata server and clients, the interfaces used by other\nwell-known file systems, and the expectations users may have going forward.</p>"

This framework examines the development and deployment of technology across four critical areas: the actors involved or affected, the dynamics and relationships within impacted communities, the economic realities faced by researchers, and environmental impact. Additionally, I will highlight practical methods for addressing the potential negative consequences of our work.</p>\n<p>This session is designed for anyone involved in open source/science, including researchers, designers, contributors, developers, maintainers, and community members who seek to better understand and navigate the ethical challenges of open research and technology.

However, the diversity of these technologies can be confusing, particularly for new maintainers. I personally found it challenging to understand. The introduction of the new CI/CD admin role and the discussions in the RFC are promising developments that should help clarify these complexities.</p>\n<p>AMD ROCm‚Ñ¢ is based on the LLVM project, which is why AMD is deeply invested in supporting its development. This includes providing resources to test the AMDGPU code generation backend and various GPU offloading programming models. Consequently, AMD maintains a range of upstream buildbots for this purpose.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, I discuss the motivation and objectives behind the AMD ROCm‚Ñ¢ compiler buildbots and related initiatives. I share my two-year journey, which began with inheriting a single buildbot, then another, and eventually maintaining multiple machines and bot configurations. I delve into the technical challenges I encountered and the solutions I implemented. I also touch on non-technical issues from my perspective and how they were resolved by both me and the community. The presentation concludes with a forward-looking perspective on potential additions to the upstream test infrastructure to address existing blind spots from our point of view.</p>"

We'll discuss our work with large Polish datasets, examining the intricacies of the training process for our compact model.</p>\n<p>Our presentation will provide insights into the process of model development, from creating high-quality Polish language datasets to enhancing cooperation between an open-source foundation and academic institution. We'll also discuss the balance between model size and performance, highlighting how we make advanced language models accessible for practical use.</p>"

You'll need your own laptop (no installs needed, Hedy is webbased) and reading- and basic typing skills (or someone to help you read and type). No prior programming experience is needed. When you have finished all 18 levels of Hedy, you know the basics of Python.</p>"
