# FOSDEM PWA Companion App

This is a companion app for [FOSDEM 2024](https://fosdem.org/2024/), built with [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/) and using [the shadcn UI library](https://ui.shadcn.com/), it is a PWA that can be installed on your phone or desktop.

This is heavily inspired by [sojourner-web](https://github.com/loomchild/sojourner-web/tree/master), just in TanStack Router.
